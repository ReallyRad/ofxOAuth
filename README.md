# ofxOAuth

A wrapper for [liboauthcpp](https://github.com/sirikata/liboauthcpp), a C++ implementation of the OAuth v1.1 protocol.  

## Requirements
* [ofxCurl](https://github.com/morphogencc/ofxCurl)

### Windows
To use this add-on, use the projector generator.  Once you've created a project, use the `ofxOAuth.props` property sheet in `config/` to set up your compiler properly.

This library has been tested with Visual Studio 2015 and openFrameworks v0.9.1

### OSX
This project is currently not configured for Xcode in OSX.  If anyone wants to take this on, I'd be glad to help.  Otherwise you'll have to wait until I have a reason to need it on my Mac :)
